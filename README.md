# ai-trained-hub
The project is an application built on a microservice architecture. The basic idea is to provide a platform where users can upload their trained artificial intelligence (AI) models. Other users, in turn, can use these models to make predictions on their data. This allows you to share knowledge and skills in the field of AI, facilitating the learning and development process.

!!! ProfileApi and ModelPredictionApi are in development
